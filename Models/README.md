### The Transliteration models

The models contain hieroglyphic words encoded with Manuel de Codage and all the possible transliterations found in the corpus as well as their frequences and relative frequences (amongst the transliterations for that specific word). For the word-transliteration pairs taken from the AES, the original lemma(s) has also been added.

* _The RamsesTrainingSetModel.json_ is made from the Ramses Transliteration Corpus training set.
* _The AESModel.json_ is made from the Ancient Egyptian Sentences corpus.
* _The AES+RamsesTrainingSetModel.json_ is a combination of the two models.
